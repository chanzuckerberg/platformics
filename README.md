Platformics
---
Platformics is a GraphQL API framework that relies on code generation to implement a full featured GraphQL API on top of a PostgreSQL database, with support for authorization policy enforcement and file persistence via S3.

In short, BYOS - bring your schema, and be up and running with a real-world GraphQL API in no time flat.
